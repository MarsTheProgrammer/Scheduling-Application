How to Run Program:

    To run the program the user must login with "test" as the username and password or "admin" as the username and password. 
    
      Once logged in, you will be at the main menu. Here you can select the customer screen. This will display a customers table with the ability to add,
    delete, modify, and return to the main menu. When clicking on the main menu, you will be prompted with any appointments in the next 15 minutes.
    
      Once at the main menu you will be informed of any upcoming appointments and you can select on the appointments button. 
    This will take you to the appointments page. Here you can add, modify and delete appointments. You can also filter the 
    appointments by month and week, or return to the original list by pressing the all appointments button.

      Once at the main menu you will be informed of any upcoming appointments. You can then click on the reports page and select from the various
    reports. The first report is the number of appointments by month and type. The second report is table of all the appointments of a specified
    contact. The last report is the number of appointments per customer.

Description of additional report:

    For the last report on the Reports screen, I created the ability to count how many appointment each customer has. 
  Simply select a customer from the combo box and the number will apprear next to the necessary label.
